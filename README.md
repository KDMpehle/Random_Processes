The repository contains (mostly) python code for a variety of procedures in 
probabilistic modelling. Notably there a scripts for simulating fractional
Brownian motion using the Davies-Harte method,multifractional
Brownian motion using Riemann-Liouville integral approximations
and 2-D stationary Gaussian fields with the Davies-Harte method
. Also present are scripts illustrating introductory classical extreme value theory as well as related statistical tests.
